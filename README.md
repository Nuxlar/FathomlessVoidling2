# Fathomless Voidling

I think the idea should be more chaotic, so moves last after activation or maybe activate with each other. Unless you want to add mobs. Could also remove the center shield and add a ton of armor to the main body like wing. Would have to make attacks not originate from the eye because of the leg rotation and obviously survivors just sitting on his head.
Maybe external components that randomize attack intervals, like a big laser that zaps 1 area of the donut
Killing a joint spawns "mines"?

Or do I just scrap big voidling and use these ideas for solus wing since that boss is just a better big voidling.

"Auto" attacks
    - Unsafe zones: random pillars that cause damage if you're in them
