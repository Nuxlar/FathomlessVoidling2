# Fathomless Voidling

How to make a raid boss less monotonous:
    - Environment hazards in the arena
    - Additional "skills" or attacks that aren't tied to the main body

Exploring hazards:
    - Void fog, though might just have this integrated with the main attacks
    - "mines" that dont do damage but maybe a version of the gravity bump from the original kit
    - convert the phase transition safe pillars into a damaging "projectile"

Voidling attacks should be large scale, cinematic, typical raid boss stuff. The joints should be mixing things up.

Voidling Skills
    - Primary: Eye Blast (removes tracking from normal projectiles, increases size, blast radius, and adds oscillation)
    - Secondary: Portal Beams (really liked this from the initial draft)
    - Utility: Missile Barrage
    - Special: One of the singularities ig

Skill ideas to mess around with
    - Missile Barrage: "missiles" visually that are actually more like mortars behaviorally
    - Abyssal Vision: Spawns a disembodied "eye" that fires a shotgun blast
    - Singularity: Can just be an enlarged version of the vanilla one, since there's more stuff going on, could be fun.
    - Wandering Singularity: Fathomless first draft, a black hole that slowly wanders and instantly kills, personally not a fan of the visuals just clipping through things.
    - Targeted Singularity: The vanilla black hole, but spawns based on player position, so warning bubble, then starts the black hole at different locations.
    - Asteroid Barrage: Spawns "orbiting" asteroids that are launched (one by one or simultaneously) or fall from the sky

Add skilldrivers to the joints and have them do some attacks, the "auto" or "hazard" ones. So while voidling is doing the big, grandiose attacks, the joints are adding to the chaos.
