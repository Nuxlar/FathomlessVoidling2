# Fathomless Voidling

How to make a raid boss less monotonous:
    - Environment hazards in the arena
    - Additional "skills" or attacks that aren't tied to the main body

Exploring hazards:
    - Void fog, though might just have this integrated with the main attacks
    - "mines" that dont do damage but maybe a version of the gravity bump from the original kit
    - convert the phase transition safe pillars into a damaging "projectile"

Voidling attacks should be large scale, cinematic, typical raid boss stuff. The joints should be mixing things up.

Voidling Skills
    - Primary: Eye Blast (removes tracking from normal projectiles, increases size, blast radius, and adds oscillation)
    - Secondary: Portal Beams (really liked this from the initial draft)
    - Utility: Void Laser
    - Special: One of the singularities ig
    - Per phase changes
        - So not sure if I wanna make new abilities for the phases or just add more hazards/joint skills instead while buffing each ability based on the phase
        - PortalBeam is pretty simple, increase the quantity and frequency values per phase
        - EyeBlast could either add more missiles or more "waves"

Skill ideas to mess around with
    - Void Laser: Multiple possibilties here
        - Predictively point in a certain direction
        - The normal spinny one to sweep the donut arena (force players to get up on the parkour bits)
        - Spawns a portal and blasts a part of the arena (kinda like this one, block off a bit of the arena)
        - Laser sweeps a part of the arena, sees where player is for general direction, then sweeps that area with the laser
    - Abyssal Vision: Spawns a disembodied "eye" that fires a shotgun blast
    - Singularity: Can just be an enlarged version of the vanilla one, since there's more stuff going on, could be fun.
    - Asteroid Barrage: Spawns "orbiting" asteroids that are launched (one by one or simultaneously) or fall from the sky

Add skilldrivers to the joints and have them do some attacks, the "auto" or "hazard" ones. So while voidling is doing the big, grandiose attacks, the joints are adding to the chaos. 

Known Issues:
- Joint respawn not networked
